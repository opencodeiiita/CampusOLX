Your **Fourth Task** is to design the Footer Section of the Website CampusOLX. This is a 30 **points** task.

CampusOLX, as the name implies, is a local online marketplace specifically designed for students at IIIT-A to buy and sell second-hand items, such as furniture, electronics, and other household goods. By providing a platform for students to sell items they no longer need or use, CampusOLX can help students save money on living expenses and make it easier for them to find affordable products. It can also be a convenient way for students to sell items they no longer need, allowing them to declutter and make some extra money. The website provides the convenience of being able to buy and sell items directly with other students on campus may make it an appealing option for students at IIIT-A.

The task needs to be done on **Figma**. Figma is free to use and doesn't need to download. It is very easy to learn and hardly takes 20 minutes to learn. If you are unclear on how to use it, check the tutorial here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk1T0CdLxwU&t=784s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk1T0CdLxwU&t=784s)

## Procedure:

1. Your task is to decide on the Footer Section of the website. It is essentially nothing but the landing page of a website. Whenever a user reaches the end of the home page or any page for that matter he/she ends up seeing the footer of the website.
2. You have to design the Footer of the website. 
3. Remember that this is the section that lets the user know about the organization of campus Olx, copywriting of the website, social media handles of the organization, etc.
4. Finally, create your ideal Home page on a Figma file and provide its link (in a .txt file). Submit your txt files in the **Task 2: Hero Section Design** folder only.

> ✨PRO-TIP: Designing any piece of UI requires the following basic steps: firstly research similar websites’ footer sections (note down the key elements the placement and the arrangement) and get familiar with footer sections, secondly the wire-frame (deciding where to place which element and what all has to be placed on the page) of the home page must be done, thirdly the visual design must be given (deciding the color scheme, the font styles, weight and size, the graphics on the page) and implementing the visual design, and finally some basic touch-ups!!

## **MDC (Minimum Design Criteria):**

The Footer Section of the website should look like a footer section. It must have the logo(which you have made in task 3), the organization of the website, the copywriting, the social media handles, etc. Remember that the same theme is followed in making the footer the theme used on the home page. Make sure the footer looks good and just as the footers look on general websites. Try to keep the options on the footer quite minimal. Only good designs will be merged.

> ✨PRO-TIP: You must search Figma Mirror on google and then select our frame on Figma and you would be able to see how your website would look on the screen. Take references of sizes and spacing from there. Make sure you maintain consistency in your design.
