# CampusOLX 🛒
An Imperative Web Design Repository
</br>
</br>
CampusOLX, as the name implies, is a website that provides buyers and sellers with a platform where they can buy used items to save money on hostel expenses while allowing sellers to sell items that are no longer in use.
</br>
</br>
Hola @contributors, we invite you to design the Campus OLX website, to use your creativity and design skills to tailor this website from the very beginning, from thinking about the user flow to implementing the visual design you have got to do it all!
</br>
</br>
> Website design is an extremely crucial aspect as it determines the very first impression we make on our audience. It impacts how our audience perceives us and this impression can either get them to remain on our page or leave it.

- The Repository is divided into several tasks. Each task will be opened subsequently for a limited amount of time and all the submissions have to be made within those allotted days only. NO submission will be accepted after the allotted time ends. The details for the specific tasks and the time allotted for each can be found in their specific folders.
- The submissions will be scored by the mentors, out of maximum points for that particular issue, based on the various aspects of design like design thinking, originality, visual appeal, etc. The best submission will be awarded full points.
- The submissions will be judged by the mentors and points will be allotted by them for each particular task based on various aspects and intricacies of design like design thinking process, originality of the idea, visual appeal of the submission, etc.
    
All the designs that qualify the **Minimum Design Criteria (MDC)**, will be awarded full points, rest have to make improvements in their design till their PR is merged.
